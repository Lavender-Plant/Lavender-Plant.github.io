    <h2>About Lavender</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Main Types of Lavender</h2>

    <h3>1. English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</h3>
    <p>
        English lavender is the most common and popular type. It has a sweet, floral scent 
        and is often used for essential oils, perfumes, and cooking. It grows well in 
        cooler climates and blooms in late spring to early summer.
    </p>

    <h3>2. French Lavender (Lavandula dentata)</h3>
    <p>
        French lavender has toothed leaves and a lighter fragrance. It blooms for a long 
        season and is often grown as a decorative plant. It prefers warmer climates.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Spanish Lavender (Lavandula stoechas)</h3>
    <p>
        Spanish lavender is known for its unique flower shape, which looks like it has 
        small “rabbit ear” petals on top. It has a stronger scent and thrives in hot, 
        dry climates.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia)</h3>
    <p>
        Lavandin is a hybrid of English and spike lavender. It produces larger plants 
        and more oil, making it popular for commercial production. Its scent is slightly 
        stronger and more camphor-like.
